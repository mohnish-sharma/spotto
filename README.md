*"Every car has a story. Let Spotto help you tell it"*

Spotto is mobile application designed for automotive enthusiasts to share their sighting of rare, or interesting vehicles. Users will be able to capture photos, tagged with location data, and add some short detailed information about the cars they encounter in their day to day lives. The app creates a personal digital collection of spotted vehicles, with an option to contribute to a global database that users can access to browse finds and connect with fellow enthusiasts.
