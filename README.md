[toc]



- What is your app? Include a title, short 'tagline' and a 1-2 paragraph description of what your app will do.

- Describe the main features of your app.    
- Who are the users of your app? Describe user groups, consider  constructing user personas, describe how users will use your app and why they might choose it over competitors.
- Illustrate your app design with wireframes or mockups (generated with Figma). These should show both the visual design of your app and  how users will interact with it (eg. transitions between screens)  Present your design as screenshots      interspersed with text.
- Describe which parts of your design you will aim to implement for your MVP (or what you will leave out)
