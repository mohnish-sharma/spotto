## Users Groups & Personas

### Target User Groups

The target user group for this app will be:

* Age range: 15+
* All genders 
* Automotive Enthusiasts
  * With varying levels of technical knowledge
  * Individuals with an interest in unique vehicles
  * Tourists
  * Social media influencers (ones that focus on automotive content of course)
* Vehicle Collectors
  * Documenting potential acquisitions
  * Using this as a platform to showcase their portfolio



### User Personas

**John Doe - Dedicated Car Enthusiasts**

* 20 year old student
* Car spotting is a big hobby, often spend time at car meets or prime areas looking for interesting cars
* Knowledgeable about vehicle specifications and makes
* Currently mainly uses Instagram, but desires more organisation and real world application.

John would be able to use the app often, primarily using the documentation features to record more detailed information about each vehicle spotted than Instagram would offer. The location features would help with planning routes through areas where unique and rare cars are commonly seen, and the community features would help John connect with other enthusiasts.

**Jane Doe - Casual Observer**

* 36 year old teacher
* Casual interest in carspotting, perhaps taking pictures of unique vehicles during their daily commute
* Limited knowledge about vehicle specifications and makes
* Currently just taking occasional photos stored in their camera roll without organisation

Jane would be able to use the app's basic features, focusing on quick photo capture to organise cars they encounter by whatever category they define. She would also benefit educationally from the community features as she would learn car model and makes by descriptions posted from more mechanically inclined enthusiasts. The privacy features would be important as she most likely would not prefer to disclose locations or photos publicly.

The camera interface includes guides for framing pictures, camera options including flash, exposure and adjusting the framing grid, as well as quick access to swapping to video. After capturing a photo users will be directed to to the Detail Entry page where they can enter a few more details about the car they just spotted.

## Detail Entry Page

The detail entry screen allows users to input vehicle information with fields of make, model, year, colour, modifications, any personal notes, and whether to include location data.

The personal collection view can be toggled between grid, list and map representations to help with sorting through it. Each entry shows a small thumbnail and basic information, that can be expanded.

## Map Page

![map_page](https://github.com/MQ-COMP3130/mobile-application-development-mohnish-sharma/blob/main/images/map_screen.png)

The map interface will display spotting locations by using location data entered by the user and displaying it in a visual format. Users will be able to search and filter by vehicle type, colour, etc.

# MVP Features

The Minimum Viable Product will focus on delivering a fully functional and appealing core experience, including all of the main features described, with the exception of authentication and security, as that is not  required for showcasing the main features and functionality of the app, but can be added at a later date when the product is ready for release.
