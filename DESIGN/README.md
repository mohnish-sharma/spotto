# Mobile Application Development Project for COMP3130


# Spotto

*"Every car has a story. Let Spotto help you tell it"*

Spotto is mobile application designed for automotive enthusiasts to share their sighting of rare, or interesting vehicles. Users will be able to capture photos, tagged with location data, and add some short detailed information about the cars they encounter in their day to day lives. The app creates a personal digital collection of spotted vehicles, with an option to contribute to a global database that users can access to browse finds and connect with fellow enthusiasts.

## Wireframes & Mockups

## Home Screen

The home screen features a clean interface with quick access to the camera, personal collection, map view, as well as displaying recently contributed images. (the user can tap on each section to expand it).

## Camera "Spotting" Interface

The camera interface includes guides for framing pictures, camera options including flash, exposure and adjusting the framing grid, as well as quick access to swapping to video. After capturing a photo users will be directed to to the Detail Entry page where they can enter a few more details about the car they just spotted.

## Detail Entry Page

The detail entry screen allows users to input vehicle information with fields of make, model, year, colour, modifications, any personal notes, and whether to include location data.

## Collections Page

![collections_page](https://github.com/MQ-COMP3130/mobile-application-development-mohnish-sharma/blob/main/images/collection_screen.png)

The personal collection view can be toggled between grid, list and map representations to help with sorting through it. Each entry shows a small thumbnail and basic information, that can be expanded.

## Map Page

![map_page](https://github.com/MQ-COMP3130/mobile-application-development-mohnish-sharma/blob/main/images/map_screen.png)

The map interface will display spotting locations by using location data entered by the user and displaying it in a visual format. Users will be able to search and filter by vehicle type, colour, etc.

| *User profiles and analysis* | Users? What users?   | Some thought about who will use the app.                  | Clear ideas about who will use it and what they will want/need. | Very clear how the user profiles have influenced the design of the app. |
| *Visual Design*              | Messy or missing     | Functional visual design that might work as a basic demo. | Good design elements showing some thought about the app functionality. | Visual design that will work for this app and these users, impressive, beautiful! |
| *Interaction Design*         | Confused or missing  | Basic interaction showing buttons and screens             | Clear how the interaction flows through the app and is facilitated by the design. | Your users will be impressed by how easy your app is to use. |
